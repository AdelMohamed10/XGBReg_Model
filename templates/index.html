    <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
    <p>
      Predicting house prices is a crucial aspect of the real estate industry.
      Accurate predictions help stakeholders like buyers, sellers, and investors
      to make informed decisions. Our model aims to predict the
      <strong>Median House Value</strong> for properties based on several
      factors, such as geographical location, demographics, and property
      attributes.
    </p>
    <p>
      By analyzing historical data, our machine learning model can provide fair
      and reliable predictions to assist in real estate decision-making.
